/*This is a program to calculate area of a circle after getting the radius as input from the user*/
//variables for storing radius and area
//entering the value for radius of the circle as float data type
//Mathematical function pow is used to calculate square of radius
//displaying the results
/*A test run for the program was carried out and following output was observed
If 50 is the radius of the circle whose area is to be calculated
The area of the circle is 7857.1429*/
